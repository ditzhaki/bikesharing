# NYC Citibike Bikesharing

## Overview

The focus of this challenge is to explore the possibility of starting a bikeshare business (like that of citibike in nyc) for the town of Des Moines, Iowa. With potential investors already identified, the goal is to convince them that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. 

Although Des Moines is vastly different than New York City, analyzing data from Citibikes can help identify some key points such as who uses the bikeshare program, when, and where. The Tableau Story containing the relevant visualizatinons  can be found at the following [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diana6142/viz/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16585883991620/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes).

## Results

### Customer Breakdown

To kick off our analysis, we can dive into the breakdown of the types of customers and genders that use the bikeshare program.

Our first visualization shows that those who use the bikeshare program are split between short term customers and annual subscribers, with subscribers accounting for over 75% of users. 

We can similarly explore the gender breakdown of the users.

From our pie chart, we can see that majority of users are males accounting for approximately 65% of users while females only made up approximately 25%. The remainder are unknown / undeclared. 

### Checkout Times

The next portion of our analysis depicts the checkout time for users.

From the figure above, we can see the relationship between the number of trips and their duration. The graph shows that the majority of trips are under a half-hour in length with a steep drop as the duration increases to an hour. We can further analyze the relationship by breaking it down by gender.

The relationship between number of trips and their duration remains the same for each gender. This visualization further supports that majority of users are those that identify as male.
